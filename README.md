## 🟢 Task 1 – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### 📌 Description
In Task 1, a **Linear Regression model** was built to predict house prices using the **California Housing dataset**.  
This task focuses on understanding the complete machine learning workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

### 🔍 Workflow
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Performed data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Handled missing values and non-numeric features
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated the model using MAE, RMSE, and R² score
- Visualized Actual vs Predicted house prices

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn

## 🟢 Task 2 – Feature Engineering & Model Comparison

### 📌 Description
Task 2 focuses on **feature engineering, feature scaling, and comparing multiple machine learning models** to determine the best-performing model using evaluation metrics.

### 🔍 Workflow
- Loaded the California Housing dataset using Scikit-learn
- Performed data exploration and preprocessing
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
- Evaluated models using RMSE and R² score
- Compared model performance
- Visualized Actual vs Predicted house prices

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
